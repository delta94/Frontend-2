1/ Đồng nhất cách khai báo 1 hàm
export const insertTreeFolderService = data => {};
=>
export const insertTreeFolderService = (data: any) => {};

2/ Đồng nhất ghép chuỗi
axios.get(urlCJ + '/' + folderId + '/cjs',...);
=>
const url = `${urlCJ}/${folderId}/cjs`;
axios.get(url);

3/ Đồng nhất khai báo action types
CAMPAIGN_MANAGEMENT
=>
CAMPAIGN_MANAGEMENT_ACTION_TYPES (like: AUTH_ACTION_TYPES)

export const PROPS_MANAGEMENT = {
  GET_LIST_PROPS: 'tagManagement/GET_LIST_PROPS',
  =>
  GET_LIST_PROPS: 'propsManagement/GET_LIST_PROPS',
};

4/ Quy hoạch lại css
className="app-footer" => cùng 01 class khai báo trên 7 file css khác nhau
className="app-main__outer" => cùng 01 class khai báo trên 5 file css khác nhau

5/ Áp dụng đa ngôn ngữ triệt để
state = {
    isShow: false,
    value: 'Chọn giá trị',
    classNameMenu: 'izzi-dropdown-menu show'
  };

 placeholder={'Chọn thẻ'}

 <td className="none-data" colSpan={100}>
